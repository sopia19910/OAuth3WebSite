3. Overview & Vision
3.1 What is OAuth 3?
OAuth 3 is a next-generation hybrid authentication protocol that fuses the usability of Web2 with the security and decentralization of Web3. It is designed to address the long-standing conflict between convenience and control in digital identity systems. By enabling users to authenticate using familiar Web2 credentials (e.g., Google, Kakao, Facebook) while securely managing assets and identity on the blockchain, OAuth 3 dramatically lowers the entry barrier to Web3 ecosystems.

At its core, OAuth 3 leverages a multi-layered architecture that combines:

Web2 Social Login Authentication

Web3 Private Key Ownership

Smart Contract Automation

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for privacy

This integrated approach allows users to interact with blockchain-based services as easily as they would with traditional applications—without sacrificing control, privacy, or security.

3.2 Vision: A New Standard for Internet Authentication
The vision behind OAuth 3 is to redefine digital trust for the next generation of internet users. It seeks to establish a universal, user-centric identity layer that is:

Secure by Design: No single point of failure. Multi-factor authentication is enforced on-chain using smart contracts.

User-Friendly: No need to remember seed phrases or manage keys manually. Users can log in with existing Web2 accounts.

Privacy-Preserving: Sensitive information is never exposed to the blockchain. ZKPs ensure that authentication proofs remain confidential.

Interoperable: OAuth 3 is chain-agnostic and supports integration across multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and TRON.

Decentralized: Governance, reward systems, and authentication rules are controlled by the community through token-based voting.

3.3 The Mission
OAuth 3’s mission is to empower users and organizations with a unified authentication system that aligns with the principles of:

Self-sovereignty over identity and data

Scalability to support enterprise-level applications

Accessibility to onboard the next billion users to Web3

Sustainability through token-based incentives and decentralized governance

By combining the best of both digital worlds, OAuth 3 aspires to become the new global standard for secure, decentralized, and user-friendly authentication.

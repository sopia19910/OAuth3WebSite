7. Tokenomics
The OAuth 3 ecosystem is powered by OA3, an ERC-20 utility and governance token that fuels authentication services, incentivizes participation, and enables decentralized decision-making. The tokenomics of OA3 are designed for long-term sustainability, ecosystem alignment, and community empowerment.

7.1 Token Overview
Parameter	Details
Token Name	OAuth 3 Token
Symbol	OA3
Token Standard	ERC-20
Total Supply	1,000,000,000 OA3 (1 billion)
Initial Circulating	300,000,000 OA3 (30% of total supply)
Issuance Networks	Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche (multi-chain support)

7.2 Token Utility
OA3 serves three core functions within the OAuth 3 ecosystem:

1. Governance
OA3 holders can participate in on-chain governance to vote on:

Reward distribution policies

Authentication fees

Supported blockchains

Protocol upgrades and roadmap initiatives

This ensures a DAO-powered framework where control lies in the hands of the community.

2. Reward Distribution
OA3 is used to reward:

Individual users who hold digital assets in OAuth 3 wallets

Developers or ecosystem participants contributing value

Early adopters and referral agents

3. Service Payments
Future OAuth 3 premium services (e.g., enterprise dashboards, compliance modules, identity analytics) may require payment in OA3, increasing the tokenâ€™s functional utility and demand.

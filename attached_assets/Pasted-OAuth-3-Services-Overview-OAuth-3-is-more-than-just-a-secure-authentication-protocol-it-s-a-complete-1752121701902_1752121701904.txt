OAuth 3 Services Overview
OAuth 3 is more than just a secure authentication protocol—it's a complete service ecosystem designed for both individuals and enterprises. By combining Web2-style convenience with Web3-level security and privacy, OAuth 3 delivers customized solutions that simplify blockchain access, improve digital asset management, and empower ecosystem participants through innovative incentive models.

1. Individual User Services
“Web3 wallet that feels like Web2”

Key Features
OAuth 3 enables users to access and manage multiple blockchain accounts using familiar Web2 social logins such as Google, Kakao, Facebook, and email. It eliminates the need to memorize seed phrases or manage private keys manually.

With a single, intuitive interface, users can control assets across networks like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Tron—without the traditional complexities of Web3.

Technical Foundation
Account Abstraction (ERC-4337): Automates gas fee payments and bundles multi-step transactions into a single action.

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP): Ensures privacy by verifying user identity without exposing personal information.

2FA via Smart Contracts: Dual-layer security using both Web2 login and Web3 key signature.

User Benefits
Significantly reduced entry barriers for Web3 adoption

Seamless experience similar to using a traditional fintech app

Secure asset management without compromising privacy or control

2. Enterprise Services
“Secure and cost-efficient asset management for token foundations”

Core Offerings
OAuth 3 provides an all-in-one solution for token-issuing companies and blockchain-based foundations to securely manage digital assets without relying on expensive third-party custodians.

Innovations for Enterprises
Smart Contract-Based Automation: Automates fund disbursement rules, requiring multiple sign-offs for large withdrawals and reducing human error.

Multisig Governance: Supports complex internal governance structures with programmable multi-signature approvals.

Cross-Chain Compatibility: Enables asset management across multiple blockchain networks in one integrated interface.

Strategic Advantages
Over 90% cost reduction in custodial expenses

Enhanced security and operational transparency

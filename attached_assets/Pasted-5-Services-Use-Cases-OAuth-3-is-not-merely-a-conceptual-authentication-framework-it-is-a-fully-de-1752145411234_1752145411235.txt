5. Services & Use Cases
OAuth 3 is not merely a conceptual authentication framework—it is a fully deployable platform that delivers tangible value to both individual users and enterprises. By adapting its architecture to different needs, OAuth 3 serves as a universal bridge between traditional and decentralized identity systems.

5.1 Individual User Service: Web2-Simple, Web3-Secure Wallet
Core Value: Simplicity without Sacrificing Sovereignty
OAuth 3 enables users to manage digital assets across multiple blockchains—including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and TRON—using familiar Web2 logins (Google, Kakao, Facebook, email). No more seed phrases. No more manual key storage.

Behind the scenes, account abstraction (ERC-4337) and gas sponsorship streamline complex blockchain operations into single-click transactions. The result is a wallet experience that feels like a Web2 finance app—but with full user ownership and decentralization.

Key Features
Unified interface for multi-chain wallet management

Secure access via Web2 + EOA dual authentication

Gasless transactions for seamless UX

ZKP-based login proofs for privacy preservation

Automatic backup and recovery options

Expected Impact
OAuth 3 drastically lowers the entry barrier for mainstream users by eliminating the complexity of traditional Web3 wallets, accelerating Web3 adoption on a global scale.

5.2 Enterprise Service: Decentralized Asset Custody & Governance
Core Value: Security and Cost Efficiency
For token-issuing foundations, DAOs, and Web3 startups, OAuth 3 offers a smart contract-based custody solution that replaces expensive centralized custodians (e.g., BitGo). Organizations can enforce multi-signature controls, spending rules, and time locks via immutable on-chain governance logic.

Key Features
Programmable fund access policies (e.g., multi-approval for large withdrawals)

Full control without relying on third-party custodians

90%+ reduction in custody costs

Cross-chain asset management and multi-chain compatibility

Transparent auditing and traceability

Expected Impact
OAuth 3 empowers Web3 organizations to securely manage digital assets while optimizing operational efficiency. It removes the need for trust in intermediaries, aligning perfectly with the ethos of decentralization.

5.3 Cross-Chain Support & Ecosystem Compatibility
OAuth 3 is natively compatible with multiple blockchain environments, each with unique advantages:

Blockchain	Strengths	OAuth 3 Role
Ethereum	DeFi ecosystem, smart contract maturity	Core identity and asset layer
Solana	High throughput, fast finality	Real-time UX, NFT compatibility
BNB Chain	Low fees, rapid deployment	Gas-efficient multi-chain wallet
Avalanche	Subnet architecture, scalability	Custom enterprise environments
TRON	Content-centric, high TPS	Media and gaming identity use cases

This broad compatibility ensures that OAuth 3 users and enterprises can manage assets and identities seamlessly across ecosystems.

5.4 Competitive Advantage
OAuth 3 outperforms traditional authentication methods and Web3 wallets in security, usability, cost efficiency, scalability, and privacy. By bridging the gap between centralized and decentralized identity systems, OAuth 3 redefines the UX standard for secure authentication.
